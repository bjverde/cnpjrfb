Introduction
************

PHPRtfLite is a RTF (Rich-Text-Format) writer written in PHP.

RTF specification was defined by Microsoft(c). There are many text editors, that can interpret rtf code, but as it is specified by Microsoft Microsoft Word is (afaik) the only one with full support. For example OpenOffice.org Writer does not support nested tables.

The samples files (provided in the release) were tested:

- OpenOffice 3 Writer (does not support much)
- SoftMaker TextMaker Viewer 2010 rev577 (full support for all features in PHPRtfLite)
- Microsoft Word 2003 (full support for all features in PHPRtfLite)
